# FractionCalc

FractionCalc is a project designed to do arithmetic with fractions. It supports an arbitrary number of simplified or unsimplified fractions with an arbitrary number of operations, passed as a string through the produceAnswer method.

ex. FracCalc.produceAnswer("2 * 3 - 6 + -1_1/2 + -1/2 - -1/2 - -1/2 - 3")

Order of operations is not currently supported. The operations will be conducted from left to right (e.g. 3 + 3 * 3 = 18, not 12)
